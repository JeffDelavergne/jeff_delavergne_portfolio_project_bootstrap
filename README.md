Responsive Landing Page Built w/ Bootstrap and CSS 
This is a student project, an exercise in building a responsive landing page using Bootstrap and CSS. 
This is the first time using Bootstrap and CSS. 
Its Not perfect, but it is responsive. 
I plan on returning to this project and adding the links, cleaning up up the CSS, and fixing what is not working correctly with my break points/@mediaqueries correctly.
